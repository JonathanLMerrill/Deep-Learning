# Deep-Learning
Deep Learning Labs worked on during my senior year at BYU
### Cancer Detection
Inplementing a virtual radiologist. Samples images are given of possibly cancerous tissue samples, and the area where the cancer may reside is identified. 
### CNN and DNN Intro
An introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks and Dense Neural networks.
### Deep Learning Translator
A deep learning architecture that translates given files from Spanish to English.
### Deep Reinforcement Learning
Built DQN and PPO Deep RL algorithms.
### Pytorch Intro
An introduction to Pytorch and its capabilities
### Sequence to Sequence Models
A recurrent neural network that is trained probabilistically on sequences of characters, and that can then be used to sample new sequences that are like the original. Specifically, this method was used to create additional lines/scenes from movies.
### Stable Diffusion Image Generation
Creating images based on user imput
### Style Transfer for Combining Image Styles
Using a style transfer Algorithm to take the style from one image and imbed it upon another.
